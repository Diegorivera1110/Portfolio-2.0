# Portfolio

  ## Description
  This site is my Portfolio showcasing projects I have created from scratch. The reason my repository for my Portfolio is 2.0 is due to this is my second portfolio that I created my with a Node.js app I created (Portfolio-Generator) that runs through inquirer and generates a fully styled and functional Portfolio after all answers have been completed through the command prompt.

  ## Installation
  The easiest way to install my portfolio repository would be to git clone or download the ZIP file. 

  ## Usage
  This Project's uses are to showcase projects I have completed as well as provide links to my projects, Resume, GitHub, as well as LinkedIn. This Portfolio also shows the result of using my Portfolio Generator app that uses Inquirer to develop the whole site for the user just by answering some questions through the command prompt.
